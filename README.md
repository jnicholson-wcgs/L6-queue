# L6-queue
L6 Programming to demonstrate circular queue

Implement all the methods for the circularQ class:
- Constructor
- isFull()
- isEmpty()
- deQueue()
- enQueue()

Test your implementation with test cases, e.g.:
- isEmpty() on empty and non-empty queues
- isFull() on empty and full queuees
- deQueue() on empty and populated queues
- enQueue() on populated and full queues

Are they additional methods you could add the class?
